Sometimes, though, you don’t really want your containers to live on a separate network than the host because you want to ssh to them directly or something. There are a few ways to accomplish this, the simplest is with macvlan:

lxc profile device set default eth0 parent eth0
lxc profile device set default eth0 nictype macvlan
Another way to do this is by adding another bridge which is bridged onto your main NIC. You’ll need to edit your /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0.cfg to look like this:

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual # note the manual here
And then add a bridge by creating /etc/network/interfaces.d/containerbr.cfg with the contents:

auto containerbr
iface containerbr inet dhcp
  bridge_ports eth0
Finally, you’ll need to change the default lxd profile to use your new bridge:

lxc profile device set default eth0 parent containerbr
Restart the networking service (which if you do it over ssh, may boot you :), and away you go. If you want some of your containers to be on one bridge, and some on the other, you can use different profiles to accomplish this.
